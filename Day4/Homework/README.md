
## Presentation Preparation   

Be ready to present your completed web site and applications to your peers.  You may wish to dress sharp for your presentation, though it is not required.  Bonus points for dressing relevant to your topic (i.e. if you make an app of your favorite band, wear a shirt depicting them).   

Presentations should last 3 â€“ 5 minutes.  Much of your content can be derived from the first Homework assignment. 

Key things to consider: 

1. What did you think when you first heard the project requirements? 
2. Why did you create the website you created?  How can it be of use to others? 
3. How do you plan to market these projects going forward? 
4. What have you learned from this process? 
5. Anything else you feel is important to share?
