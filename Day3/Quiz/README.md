1. Since iOS, Android, and Windows devices all employ web browser controls, this means we can write apps for these devices in languages understood by the web (HTML / JS).

2. You want to build an app for iOS, Android, and Windows.  What development approach would you take (Native, Web App, Hybrid)?  List any specific technologies that you would employ.  Why did you go with the approach that you chose?
