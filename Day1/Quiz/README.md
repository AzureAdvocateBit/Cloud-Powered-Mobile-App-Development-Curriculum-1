Name:

1. A student wishes to create a startup business which requires a website.  The student learned some HTML 5 and JavaScript in a previous course taught by Dr. Parks.  With this knowledge, the student was able to create a website that archives copies of old tests submitted by students.  The student has an old computer and read somewhere that they could turn it into a web server to use for hosting a website.  During finals week the server receives a high amount of traffic and the hard drive dies.  This was the only server and there were no backups of the hard drive.  What could have been done to avoid this type of failure?  

2. Scalability is a great feature of cloud deployments because you can ramp up resources to meet demand as you need it.  The problem is that "more resources" typically implies "more cost".  In your own words, describe the concept of Elasticity in cloud platforms and how it can reduce deployment costs.
